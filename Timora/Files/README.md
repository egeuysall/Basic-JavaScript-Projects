# Timer App

A simple and intuitive timer application built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides functionality to start, pause, and reset a timer, making it a great starting point for learning how to work with web-based timers.

## Features

- **Start/Pause Timer**: Toggle between starting and pausing the timer with a single button.
- **Reset Timer**: Reset the timer back to `00:00` with the reset button.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is centered and visually appealing with a clean, minimalist layout.
- **Time Formatting**: Displays time in `MM:SS` format with leading zeroes for clarity.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Adds styling, including hover effects, transitions, and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the timer functionality.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `timerApp.html` file in any web browser.
3. Click:
   - **Start** to begin the timer.
   - **Pause** to pause it.
   - **Reset** to reset the timer to `00:00`.

## Code Explanation

- The **HTML** provides a simple container for the timer display and control buttons.
